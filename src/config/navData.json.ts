 * * Primary navigation — the header's link set (Figma node 5:110).

 * to match `astro.config.mjs` `trailingSlash: "always"`. `as const satisfies` keeps the literal
 * types while checking the shape.
 *
 * NOTE: only `/` ships today. `/blog/`, `/about/`, and `/contact/` are the site's intended routes
 * and will 404 until their pages land (the blog route is a deliberate later-build per AGENTS.md).
